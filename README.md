This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes difficult-to-debug error in R: calling a function that hasn't been defined or loaded into the current R session. The `bug.r` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.r` offers the corrected version.  The issue stems from attempting to use `my_nonexistent_function`, which results in an error.  The solution involves either defining the function or loading the package containing it. This example highlights the importance of careful function definition and package management in R.
